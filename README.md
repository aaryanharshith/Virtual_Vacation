Sometimes, when I least expect it, I realize just how big our world really is.

I made Virtual Vacation to share a fragment of that wonder with you. 

It's simple. On a rainy day, grab a cup of cocoa, settle down on your bed, and discover something new.

The background music for this project came from an amazing artist, Keys of Moon. Their work really helped tied the site together. Feel free to check out their work here:

This project also wouldn't have been possible without my best friends, Grace and Aspen, for bearing with me as I ranted about pesky bugs.
On that note, another huge shoutout to Anjali, my CS 106A TA, for poking and prodding at my ideas till I found something I could get behind.

And finally, you. Thanks for visiting what I created. I hope it made you smile :)
